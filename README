'RmSQL' is an R package which implements an interface between the R
language and the mSQL database system and is Copyright (C) 1999, 2000 by

This is very basic interface and more or less just a wrapper to the mSQL
API, useful mainly for programming.

INSTALLATION:

*************************************************************************

1. get mSQL version => 2.0.8 from www.Hughes.com.au. Note that mSQL is NOT
GPL licenced but free of charge for universities and noncommercial orgs. 

2. install mSQL (see mSQL README and manual)

3. if server and client are on the same host, unpack RmSQL-0.1.tar.gz in 
$RHOME/library/, check ./RmSQL/src/Makevars for your mSQL-path and type 
"R INSTALL RmSQL" as root. This should make RmSQL correct.

4. if not, tell ./RmSQL/src/Makevars where to search for libmsql.a and
msql.h (and copy them on the client machine). 

5. to run the crash example, create a database called "crash" by
">$MSQL_HOME/bin/msqladmin create crash" , copy ./RmSQL/Example/* into your
working directory and run R> source("crash.R"). If no error message is
printed and sdata contains data, you are on :-)
