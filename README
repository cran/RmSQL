INSTALLATION:

*************************************************************************

1. get mSQL version => 2.0.8 from www.Hughes.com.au. Note that mSQL is NOT
GPL licenced but free of charge for universities and noncommercial orgs. 

2. install mSQL (see mSQL README and manual)

3. if server and client are on the same host, unpack RmSQL-0.1.tar.gz in 
$RHOME/library/, check ./RmSQL/src/Makefile for your mSQL-path and type 
"R INSTALL RmSQL" as root. This should make RmSQL correct (make sure that
SHLIBFLAGS are set correct) 

4. if not, copy the mSQL include and lib dirs on the client and change the
Makefile

5. to run the crash example, create a database called "crash" by
">$MSQL_HOME/bin/msqladmin create crash" , copy ./RmSQL/Example/* into your
working directory and run R> source("crash.R"). If no error message is
printed and sdata contains data, you are on :-)
