This is a little example using a little dataset which I found on my harddisk
by random :-)

The file crash.txt contains data from car accidents happend in 1980-1982 in
Nordrhein-Westfalen, a territory of germany.

6 variables are listed:

First, four variable of the drivers having an accident:
 
age:	1: younger then 25, 2: 25-60 years old, older the 60  
sex:	0: female driver, 1: male driver
alc:	0: driver not drunken, 1: driver drunken 
street:	kind of street: 1: streets in town, 2: country road, 3: autobahn

And second, the kind and cause of accident:

bcrash:	bad crash: number of accidents with combination (age, sex, alc, street), which
	were caused by speeding, risky driving and so on
gcrash: good crash: number of accidents not caused by speeding or risky
	driving with combination (age, sex, alc, street). 

crash.R reads the data, defines a table and saves the data in the database
system. The we can "ask questions" using SQL-statements. Of cource, all this
can be done with dataframes, but not more complex things like joins etc. One
should look at the comments in crash.R to see RmSQL working.
